ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Navigator365!

Got my start in programming by joining my local FRC team The RoboBees (#836) during the 2019-2020 competition year. Most of our team's code is on GitLab [here, to be precise](https://gitlab.com/growingstems/frc-836-the-robobees), 
so I use Github for messing around with personal repositories, usually involving math or scripting.
